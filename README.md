# Instacart Data Analytics:Driving E-Commerce Profitability & Operational Efficiency (SQL & Power BI)
# Project Overview
This project is an in-depth, data-driven analysis of Instacart's operational and sales data, utilizing SQL for complex data manipulation and Power BI for interactive visualization.
The primary goal is to provide Instacart's Management with a dynamic, centralized dashboard that shifts focus from high-level performance metrics to granular insights into profitability, demand forecasting, and inventory optimization

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The primary dashboard tracks the following core KPIs to monitor business health:

-  Total Orders: Volume of completed transactions.

-  Total Customers: Count of unique customers served.

-  Total Revenue: Gross sales generated.

-  Average Order Value (AOV): Revenue per order, indicating customer spending behavior.

# Business Objectives & Strategic Problems
This analysis directly addresses four (4) critical business problems through data interrogation:

- Profit Leakage in Aisles (Optimizing Margins):

  Goal: Inform purchasing teams to negotiate better supplier pricing or reduce low-margin items in underperforming aisles.

  Requirement: Identify aisles with high customer demand but disproportionately low profitability.

- Product Portfolio Review (Inventory Management):

  Goal: Promote high-performing products through marketing campaigns and evaluate underperforming products for potential discontinuation or improvement.

  Requirement: Identify the top 5 best-performing and bottom 5 worst-performing products based on total sales volume and revenue.

- Labor Cost Optimization (Operational Efficiency):

  Goal: Optimize employee shift scheduling to match demand, ensuring peak efficiency and reducing labor costs during low-activity periods.

  Requirement: Determine the busiest time blocks (hour of day/day of week) for order activity.

- Inventory & Marketing Alignment (Demand Forecasting):

  Goal: Plan inventory levels and align marketing spend ahead of predicted demand spikes, minimizing overstocking risks.

  Requirement: Analyze historical sales trends to predict future demand spikes and seasonal dips.
